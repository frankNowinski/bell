            <em>Pennie is Punk</em> is a photo magazine about wearing denim in a punk way

            This project involved discovering creative ways to wear denim.
            So for the first photo, I cut scrap of denim from a pair of old jeans
            to make a choker which emphasizes the material's versatility.

            The titles for each page are pretty random, and are a result of how the photos feel to me.
